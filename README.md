## Welcome to Mirantis Labs Christmas Special 

Here you will find information on how you can help Santa deliver the presents on time!

You can find general information [here](https://www.mirantis.com/labs/learning/techtalks/mirantis-labs-christmas-special-code-challenge). 
> **Important**: Please make sure to read the description carefully. When you are ready, please submit your results [here](https://forms.gle/vxRskTs9wqt4PwjJ7).

### Challenge

This repository contains the manifest files for the toy making application that are needed for the challenge. 

Santa mentions that he needs a way to package an application. The application is crucial for distributing presents.

Since Santa has different locations for distributing presents there needs to be a way to easily specify the *value* for the region when deploying the application to Kubernetes. The value will be used by the application as environment variable, called *secret_location*.

Please create a public git repository (Gitlab/Github/etc.) with your solution and a description what is needed to deploy it. 

#### Advanced

This was way too easy for you? Okay... Which Open Source product of Mirantis can be used to deploy a Kubernetes Cluster including the package you've created?

> **Hint**: There is binary and/or a CLI you can use to specify the cluster configuration and add your package to it. One ends with ..s and the other with ...ctl. Perhaps you can find it [here](https://github.com/k0sproject)?

If you found it, please also create a yaml which includes the configuration for a simple cluster and the application. The cluster configuration does not matter, only the part where you specify which package should be installed. 


Best of luck and we which you a:
